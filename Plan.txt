F(x)=y	GOAL: estimate function F using ARIMA, LR, deep RNN, LSTM		
y = PRC	Average of close of business bid and ask of each SPY, and 10 sector ETFs		
x = BIDLO, ASKHI, VOL of each asset (SPY and 10 sector ETFs) + Treasury rates			
			
1. Yoshi: Data-> train, validate, test			
2. Zimo, Xu Yiting: train your model on the training dataset, choose hyperparameters on validation dataset			
	Zimo: ARIMA and LR		
	Xu: RNN & RNN-DO		
	Yiting: RNN dense and LSTM					
Deadlines:			
22nd October: one page description of the project -> Overleaf			
	Dataset: WRDS dataset to download historical data on SPY, 10 sector ETFs		
	Goal: predict next COB price of SPY and 10 sector ETFs, given previous 100 days data on SPY and 10 Sector ETFs		
	Description of each method and why we think is good		
		LR is the standard method and we use as a benchmark (i.e. a method is considered good if it does better than LR)	
		We try ARIMA because it is typical for data with some ciclycality	
		Recurrent NN are also typical for cyclical data	
			Different ways to overcome technical issues in training RNN
			And so, we try different methods 
			
1 November: description of planned modelling approach based on data analysis for the last two weeks			
	Perhaps just mention which models are working		
			
8 November: Give an update on what we have achieved so far			
			
2 December: project due date
